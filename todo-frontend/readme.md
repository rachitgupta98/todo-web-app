# What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code on the server side, outside of a web browser. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine that powers Google Chrome, to run JavaScript code efficiently.

### Key Features of Node.js:

- Event-Driven Architecture: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient. This architecture allows Node.js to handle many connections simultaneously with high throughput.

- Asynchronous Programming: Node.js is designed for asynchronous programming, which means it can perform non-blocking operations like reading files or handling HTTP requests without waiting for these operations to complete before moving on to other tasks.

- Single-Threaded: Despite being single-threaded, Node.js can handle a large number of concurrent connections thanks to its event loop and asynchronous nature. This makes it particularly well-suited for I/O-bound tasks.

- NPM Ecosystem: Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager), which provides a massive repository of reusable JavaScript code libraries. This allows developers to easily share and reuse code, speeding up development.

- Cross-Platform: Node.js can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a versatile choice for developers.

- Scalable: Node.js applications can be scaled both vertically and horizontally, supporting the development of scalable network applications.

# NPM vs NPX

npm is the default package manager for Node.js. It is used to manage JavaScript libraries and dependencies for applications.

1. Version Management
2. Publish Packages
3. Run Scripts
4. Manage Dependencies
5. Install Packages

npx is a tool that comes with npm (starting from npm version 5.2.0). npx allows you to run Node.js commands or packages directly from the npm registry or your projectâ€™s dependencies without installing them globally

# React

React is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, specifically for web applications. It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.

Key Features of React:

- Component-Based Architecture:
  Description: React applications are built using components, which are reusable, self-contained units that encapsulate the structure, logic, and style for a part of the UI.
  Benefits: Promotes code reuse, better organization, and easier maintenance.

- Virtual DOM:
  Description: React uses a virtual DOM, a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. It updates the virtual DOM, then calculates the most efficient way to apply those changes to the actual DOM.
  Benefits: Improves performance by reducing the number of direct manipulations on the actual DOM, which are costly.
- Declarative Programming:
  Description: React allows developers to describe how the UI should look based on the application state, and React takes care of updating the view when the state changes.
  Benefits: Makes the code more predictable and easier to debug.
- Unidirectional Data Flow:
  Description: Data flows in one direction from parent to child components, making it easier to understand and control data flow within an application.
  Benefits: Improves code clarity and makes debugging easier.
- JSX (JavaScript XML):
  Description: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, which React components use to describe the UI.
  Benefits: Provides a familiar syntax for defining UI elements, making the code more readable and maintainable.

# React-DOM

React-DOM is a package that provides DOM-specific methods that allow React to interact with the DOM. While React itself is platform-agnostic and can be used to build interfaces for various environments (like mobile or desktop apps), React-DOM is specifically designed for web applications.

# Ways to create react app

1. npx create-react-app appname
2. npm create vite@latest
